📌 Why this “Missing Semester” stuff matters

Most CS courses teach algorithms, OS, AI, etc… but not the tools you use every single day.  
Without mastering these tools, you waste hours clicking, fixing, repeating, and debugging simple things manually.  
With them, you work faster, break less, automate more, and solve problems that look impossible at first.

Below is what each topic gives you 👇

🖥️ Shell → Automates tasks fast  
   👉 Example: rename 500 files in 1 command instead of clicking manually.

🔁 Shell Scripting → Runs repeat jobs automatically  
   👉 Example: auto-backup your project every night.

⌨️ Vim / Editor Mastery → Edit code at high speed  
   👉 Example: fix 20 typos across files without touching the mouse.

📊 Data Wrangling → Clean & transform data quickly  
   👉 Example: extract only error lines from a 2GB log file in seconds.

⚙️ Command-Line Environment → Customize workflow for efficiency  
   👉 Example: one shortcut opens your project + server instantly.

🔧 Git / Version Control → Tracks changes & avoids disasters  
   👉 Example: revert easily after breaking the code at 2 AM.

🐞 Debugging / Profiling → Find bugs & performance issues fast  
   👉 Example: identify which function is slowing your app.

🤖 Metaprogramming → Code that writes more code  
   👉 Example: auto-generate boilerplate instead of repeating it 50 times.

🔐 Security / Cryptography → Protect systems & data  
   👉 Example: verify downloads aren't tampered with.

🧰 Potpourri → Misc productivity hacks  
   👉 Example: CLI calculators, advanced searches, aliases, etc.
